    <h4>Course Description</h4>
    <p>
      This course is an introductory undergraduate course which overviews computer information systems.
      Concepts covered include terminology, computer hardware, software, and networks as well as
      the impact of computers and the internet on society, ethical issues in computing, trends in
      information processing, and future aspects of technology.
      Students use a computer with systems software and applications software, including a word processor, electronic spreadsheet, database management system, and web page editor to process data and present useful information.
    </p>

    <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
    <p>
      Students will learn computing terminology, various aspects of computing, applications, trends, and impact in modern society.
      Through labwork, students will develop the ability to
      (i) use Microsoft Office software, including Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint;
      (ii) create an e-portfolio/website.
    </p>

    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="text-warning">`Plagiarize` means to take and present as one`s own a material portion of the ideas or words of another or to present as one`s own an idea or work derived from an existing source without full and proper credit to the source of the ideas, words, or works.
