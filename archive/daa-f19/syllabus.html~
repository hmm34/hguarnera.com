    <h4>Course Description</h4>
    <p>
      This course is an introductory undergraduate/graduate course on the design and analysis of algorithms. The course builds on the study of the analysis and implementation of data structures and algorithms from CS 33001. The goal is to introduce a number of important algorithm design techniques as well as basic algorithms that are interesting both from a theoretical and also practical point of view. We will cover basic algorithm design techniques such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy techniques for optimization. We will cover techniques for proof of the correctness of algorithms and also asymptotic analysis of algorithm time bounds by the solution of recurrence equations. We will apply these design and analysis techniques to derive algorithms for a variety of tasks such as sorting, searching, and graph problems. Some specific algorithm topics include: deterministic and randomized sorting and searching algorithms, depth and breadth first search graph algorithms for finding paths and matchings, and algebraic algorithms for fast multiplication and linear system solving.
    </p>

    <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
    <p>
      Students will learn (i) advanced data structures and their analysis; (ii) to think algorithmically like a "real" computer scientist; (iii) different techniques and methods for designing efficient algorithms for solving computational problems. Students will develop (i) the ability to design efficient algorithms; (ii) the ability to prove correctness and evaluate efficiency of algorithms.
    </p>

  <h4>Milestones for successful completion of the course</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Attend the classes regularly</li>
    <li>Perform the homework thoroughly and independently</li>
    <li>Read the book carefully and several times</li>
    <li>Ask questions</li>
    <li>Check the course website frequently for important deadlines</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Make-up and Late policy</h4>
  <p>
    Attendance is a course requirement. Missed exams and missed homework are only excused if absence was essential and can be fully documented. Homework must be turned in by the end of class on due date, either typed and printed or hand-written. Unexcused late homework is not accepted. Class extensions on homework will be announced in class. They may also be announced by email and at the course website.
  </p>

  <h4>Homework and Collaboration</h4>
  <p>
    You will need to devote a considerable amount of time to homework. You may discuss the homework with other students, but you must write your solutions independently.  Study groups should limit their size to 2-3 so that each collaborator can participate in solution. If you obtain a solution to a homework problem through research (e.g., from books or journals), you are expected to acknowledge your sources in your writeup and also to write up your solution independently.
  </p>

  <h4>Registration Requirement</h4>
  <p>
    The official registration deadline for this course is <span class="text-danger">August 28</span>. University policy requires all students to be officially registered in each class they are attending. Students who are not officially registered for a course by published deadlines should not be attending classes and will not receive credit or a grade for the course. Each student must confirm enrollment by checking his/her class schedule (using Student Tools in FlashLine) prior to the deadline indicated. Registration errors must be corrected prior to the deadline.
</p>
<p>The last day to withdraw before a grade of "W" is assigned is <span class="text-danger">September 4</span>. No approval is necessary before this date. The last day to withdraw with a grade of "W" assigned is <span class="text-danger">October 30</span>.
  </p>

<h4>Student Survey of Instruction</h4>
<p>The Student Survey of Instruction (aka, SSI, teaching evaluations, Flash Surveys, etc.) will take place electronically. It will be available between 12:01 AM November 24 and 11:59PM December 8.
</p>


  <h4>Student Accessibility Policy</h4>
  <p>
    University Policy 3-01.3 requires that students with disabilities be provided reasonable accommodations to ensure their equal access to course content. If you have a documented disability and require accommodations, please contact the instructor at the beginning of the semester to make arrangements for necessary classroom adjustments. Please note, you must first verify your eligibility for these through Student Accessibility Services (contact 330-672-3391 or visit <a href="https://www.kent.edu/sas">www.kent.edu/sas</a> for more information on registration procedures).
  </p>

<h4>Title IX</h4>
<p>
In the event that you choose to write or speak about having survived sexualized violence, including rape, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking Kent State requires that, as your instructor, I share this information with Title IX. Someone from Title IX will contact you to let you know about accommodations and support services as well as options for holding accountable the person who harmed you. <b>You are not required to speak with them.</b>
</p>

<p>If you do not want Title IX notified, instead of disclosing this information to your instructor, you can speak confidentially with the following people on campus and in the community.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Psychological Services 330-672-2487</li>
<li>Townhall II 330-678-4357</li>
</ul>

<p>
They can connect you with support services and help explore your options now, or in the future.
</p>

  <h4>STUDENT CHEATING AND PLAGIARISM</h4>
<p>
University policy 3-01.8 deals with the problem of academic dishonesty, cheating, and plagiarism.  None of these will be tolerated in this class.  The sanctions provided in this policy will be used to deal with any violations.  If you have any questions, please read the policy at <a href="https://www.kent.edu/policyreg/administrative-policy-regarding-student-cheating-and-plagiarism">https://www.kent.edu/policyreg/administrative-policy-regarding-student-cheating-and-plagiarism</a> and/or ask.
</p>
  <p>
    Cheating and plagiarism constitute fraudulent misrepresentation for which no credit can be given and for which appropriate sanctions are warranted and will be applied. The university affirms that acts of cheating and plagiarism by students constitute a subversion of the goals of the institution, have no place in the university and are serious offenses to academic goals and objectives, as well as to the rights of fellow students.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="text-info">Academic Sanctions (from Section D).</span> The following academic sanctions are provided by this rule for offenses of cheating or plagiarism. Kent campus instructors shall notify the department chairperson and the student conduct office each time a sanction is imposed. Regional campus instructors shall notify the regional campus dean and the student conduct officer each time a sanction is imposed. Regional campus student conduct officer shall notify the Kent student conduct office each time a sanction is imposed by a regional campus Instructor. The following academic sanctions are provided by this rule for offenses of cheating or plagiarism. In those cases the instructor may:

    <ul>
      <li>Refuse to accept the work for credit; or</li>
      <li>Assign a grade of "F" or zero for the project, test, paper, examination or other work in which the cheating or plagiarism took place; or</li>
      <li>Assign a grade of "F" for the course in which the cheating or plagiarism took place; and/or;</li>
      <li>Recommend to the department chair or regional campus dean that further action specified in the rule be taken. The department chairperson or regional campus dean shall determine whether or not to forward to the academic dean or to the vice president for the extended university a recommendation for further sanction under this rule.</li>
